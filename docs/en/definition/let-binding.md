## Bind with Value

let can bind values to symbols, and symbols are divided into constants and variables.

The type will be automatically deduced according to the environment and literal,
if it cannot be deduced, it will become [Any]().

```valkyrie
let a = 1
let mut a = 2
```

## Bind with Type


```valkyrie
let i1: Integer;
let i2: Integer = 0;
```
