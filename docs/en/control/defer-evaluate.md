## Defer Evaluation

Defer evaluation is a programming technique that allows you to delay the execution of a code block until a specific point, usually when the enclosing scope is exited.

In Valkyrie, you can use the `defer` keyword to achieve defer evaluation.

Here's an example of defer evaluation in Valkyrie:

```valkyrie
fn read_file(path: Path): String {
    let mut file = File::open(path);
    defer {
        print("Closing file...");
        file.close();
    }
    file.read_to_string()
}
```

In the above code, the `defer` keyword is used to define a code block that will be executed when the function `processFile` is exited. The code block closes the file using the `close()` method. By using `defer`, we ensure that the file is always closed, regardless of how the function is exited (e.g., normal return, exception, etc.).

## `defer` in `defer`

## Exit Hooks

The defer mechanism in Valkyrie works based on the concept of exit hooks.

An exit hook is a piece of code that is executed when a specific scope is exited.

In Valkyrie, the `defer` keyword is implemented as a macro that adds an exit hook to the current scope.

Here's an example of how the `defer` macro can be implemented to add an exit hook:

```valkyrie
keyword macro defer(k: Continuation<()>) {
    @scope(caller).exit += k;
}
```

In the above code, the `defer` macro takes a continuation `k` as an argument, which represents the code block to be executed on exit. The macro then adds the continuation `k` to the exit hooks of the current scope using the `+=` operator.

Exit hooks can be added manually to a scope as well, without using the `defer` macro.

For example:

```valkyrie
@scope.exit += {
    print("Exiting Scope...");
}
```

In this code, we add an exit hook to the current scope using the `+=` operator.

The exit hook is a closure that prints a message indicating that the scope is being exited.

The defer mechanism in Valkyrie provides a convenient way to ensure that necessary cleanup or finalization code is executed when exiting a scope, improving code reliability and maintainability.
