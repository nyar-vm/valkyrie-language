In the Valkyrie language, `List` refers specifically to heterogeneous lists, whose length and element types are known at compile-time.

For homogeneous, dynamic length data should be storage in a `Array` instead.

In fact, Tuples are heterogeneous lists of fixed length.

## Syntax

```valkyrie
let List = [1u8, 2u16, 3u32];
```
